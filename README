lbar (launch bar)
this is a simple application launch bar for XWindows desktops similar to CDE's desktop bar.
Very old code by young version of me from pre-Gnome and pre-KDE era so please excuse me for any bugs.
Requires Motif Libraries(openmotif devel).
To test this simply modify Makefile for your platform then run 'make'.
