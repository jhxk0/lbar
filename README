lbar (launch bar) by HÃ¼seyin Kalyoncu
this is a simple application launch bar for XWindows desktops similar to CDE's desktop bar.
Very old code by young version of me from pre-Gnome and pre-KDE era so please apologise for any inconvenience.

To test this simply modify Makefile for your platform then run 'make'.
